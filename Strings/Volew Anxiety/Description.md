## Problem
Utkarsh has recently started taking English-language classes to improve his reading and writing skills. However, he is still struggling to learn English. His teacher gave him the following problem to improve his vowel-identification skills:

There is a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters only. Utkarsh has to start from the first letter of the string.
Each time he encounters a vowel (i.e. a character from the set {a,e,i,o,u}) he has to reverse the entire substring that came before the vowel.

Utkarsh needs help verifying his answer. Can you print the final string after performing all the operations for him?

### Input Format
- First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains N, the length of the string.
- The second line contains S, the string itself.

### Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the final string after traversing S from left to right and performing the necessary reversals.

### Sample 1:
<pre><code>Input:
2
10
abcdefghij
7
bcadage
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
Output:
hgfeabcdij
gacbade
</code></pre>
