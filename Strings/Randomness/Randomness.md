## Randomness
Define a function random_number, that takes no parameters. The function must generate a randon integer between 1 and 100, both inclusive, and return it.

Calling the function multiple times should (usually) return different numbers.

For example, calling random_number() sometimes might first return 42, then 63, then 1.
