## Problem
Mario was going to gift Princess Peach a string S of even length N.

Mario was clumsy and thus, broke the string in the middle. He now has two strings A and B such that A = S[1,N/2] and B = S[N/2 + 1,N].

Mario is not sure about the order in which he should join the strings A and B to get the string S. Thus, he joins the strings in any random order. Find whether it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string S if he joins the strings A and B in any order.

Note that S[L,R] denotes a substring of string S starting at index L and having a length (Râˆ’L+1).

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input:
 - The first line of each test case contains N - the length of the itial string S.
 - The second line contains the string S.

### Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string S irrespective of the order in which he joins the strings A and B and NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

### Sample 1:
<pre><code>Input:
4
6
abcabc
6
abcdef
4
aaaa
4
baab
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
Output:
YES
NO
YES
